# Monoprice-MP10-Source
Firmware Source Code for MP10 printers (MP10, MP10 Mini, MP Delta and maybe more)

## Branches
master: My attempt to get this ported/updated to the current version of Marlin and use Platform.io for building.
original-from-MP: Unchanged. This is what was received from MonoPrice support. Credit to [ChaseCorp](https://github.com/ChaseCorp) for getting the firmware source from MonoPrice.
